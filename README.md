# Contacts Book API Documentation

## Project Description

The "Contacts Book" project is a simple API service for managing contacts. It allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on contacts stored in an address book. This API provides endpoints to list contacts, retrieve specific contacts, add new contacts, update existing contacts, update the favorite status of contacts, and delete contacts.

## Getting Started

To use the "Contacts Book" API, follow the instructions below to set up your environment and understand the available endpoints.

### Base URL

The base URL for all API endpoints is defined in your configuration file (e.g., `.env`) as the `MONGODB_URI` variable. This URL is used to connect to the MongoDB database.

### Required Libraries

Before you start using this API, make sure the following libraries and dependencies are installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime environment.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - NoSQL database used by the project.

To install project dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
npm install
```
